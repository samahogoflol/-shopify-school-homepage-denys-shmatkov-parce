How to Run Locally
To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps. :

npm install
npm start 

Technologies Used :
HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Swiper, Parcel.

If I had more time, I would like to improve next things : 
1. would add more animations.
2. I would add loading for loading slides - in the active central slider.
3. We can collect data from the form, and instead of "Thank you" in the allerte, confirm the relevance of the entered data.
4. Would add validation of the form.
5. If you don't expand the site (don't add routing, for example), then I don't even know what else to add.
